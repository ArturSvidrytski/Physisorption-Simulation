Physisorption Simulation based on Mean-Field Theory
========================

This program allows lattice-based simulations of physicals adsorption in mesoporous structures.

To proceed, one has to have an Nvidia graphic card as the computational kernel is written using CUDA API.

Though it is a fully working version, it can be hard to get started without thorough documentation. Therefore, I will gradually provide the following updates for this repository:

* The code will be restructured according to the OOP paradigm and refined. All functions are currently put into one file, because it makes the restructuring easier for me.
* An instruction for the configuration of your computer will be provided to make your start easier.
* A reasonably concise documentation about the preprocessing and postprocessing functions written in Python will also be provided.

It was developed by me (Artur Svidrytski) while doing research in the group of Prof. Dr. Ulrich Tallarek in Marburg, Germany, in 2019 and 2020. It is distributed under the MIT license.
